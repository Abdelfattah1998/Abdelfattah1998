## 👋 Hello, I'm Abdelfattah Hasanat  
### 💻 Software Engineer | Full Stack Developer | Backend Specialist  

I'm a passionate and ambitious developer with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering and a Full-Stack Developer Certificate from AXSOS Academy. I bring experience from working as a **Back-End Engineer at Userpilot**, where I built scalable systems with Elixir and Phoenix, and currently serve as an **Instructor at UNRWA-RWTC**, teaching digital electronics and software tools.

I'm driven by clean code, elegant architectures, and continuous learning. With strong problem-solving skills and a collaborative mindset, I enjoy turning ideas into efficient digital solutions.
